# A Machine Learning Approach for Real-Time Data Analysis.

### Project Summary:
Models to Predict if the water from a source is safe to use or not.

### Operations:
- Collect the data for pH, Temperature, Turbidity, Electrical Conductivity — salt percentage and generate a Safe or Not Safe status for a specific range.
- Created three different model systems — KNN, Linear Regression, Naïve Bayes with C++ to determine each system’s accuracy.
- Used the same [dataset.txt](https://github.com/marufzaman/A-Machine-Learning-Approach-for-Real-time-data-analysis/blob/master/dataset.txt) for training and testing.
- Split the dataset into 70% and 30% group for training and testing.
- Make the project report.
